Description: ggradar2 is a plot function to draw a radar chart for data analysis.
It is inspired from ggradar. I have extended it with more cool features and made it more 
friendly with the data. It allows users to customize almost any factors in the radar chart.
Moreover, facet plotting is implemented in the package. See details
in examples.
